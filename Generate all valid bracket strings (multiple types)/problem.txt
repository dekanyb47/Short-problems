Problem: Generate all valid combinations of well-formed bracket strings (with multiple types)

You're given an integer n. Generate all well-formed bracket strings that contain n pairs of each of the following brackets: (), [], {}
Return all valid combinations that follow proper nesting rules. The order of the output does not matter.

Input:
    n = 1

Output:
    ['([{}])', '([]{})', '([]){}', ...]
